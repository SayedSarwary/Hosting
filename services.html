    <h2>Service Statement</h2>
    <div class="left_aligned">
  <p>
    I am deeply committed to serving both the academic profession and the broader community, contributing to the advancement of knowledge, leadership, and societal impact.
  </p>

  <p>
  Service to Profession: I actively engage in initiatives that strengthen the academic and professional community. This includes delivering specialized trainings to professionals from industry and institutions, sharing insights from research and best practices in leadership, organizational behavior, and HRM. I serve as session chair and discussant in international conferences, contributing to global scholarly exchange, and act as a peer reviewer for reputed journals, ensuring high-quality research dissemination. Additionally, I deliver lectures to international students and collaborate with faculty colleagues to present research findings in professional forums.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within my university and previous workplaces, I have served in numerous committees, including as a member of the Strategic Planning Committee and Accreditation Committee, Chair of the Curriculum Committee and Course File Committee, and as a member of the Academic Quality Assurance Committee, contributing to institutional governance, academic excellence, and curriculum innovation.
  </p>

  <p>
Service to Community: I am equally dedicated to engaging the broader community to foster learning, entrepreneurship, and sustainability. In 2025, I launched the Women Leadership Forum and organized panel discussions, workshops, events, and fireside chats to provide an inspiring platform for emerging women leaders. I mentored students from Shanghai and California through the PRME Global Students Mentorship Program, helping them develop responsible leadership and sustainability mindsets.
  </p>

  <p>
    To enhance student engagement and professional readiness, I involve students in research conferences and organize industry-academia collaboration events, inviting C-suite executives to share insights and formalize partnerships through MOUs. I also host guest lectures by global experts covering topics such as HR metrics, learning and development, agile strategy, and role models in women leadership, giving students exposure to real-world practices and professional networks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond leadership and entrepreneurship, I initiate and coordinate community-focused projects, including environmental campaigns, tree plantations, blood donation drives, road safety seminars, and digital literacy workshops. I organize university-wide initiatives such as Industry-Business Day, Research Day, Internship Fairs, International Students Day, and Women’s Day celebrations, which showcase student talent while strengthening ties with the broader community. Through these sustained efforts, I aim to cultivate socially responsible, empowered learners and professionals, fostering an inclusive culture of engagement, collaboration, and sustainable impact.
