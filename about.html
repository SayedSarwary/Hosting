    <p>
      With over a decade of multidisciplinary experience spanning academia, research, and community engagement across the countries, I bring a unique blend of research excellence, curriculum innovation, and inclusive leadership aligned with responsible higher education. I hold a Ph.D. in Management from the University of Hull, UK (AACSB and AMBA accredited). I am currently pursuing an Ed.D. in Adult Learning and Higher Education at Oregon State University, USA. 
  </p>
My professional certifications-including Senior Certified Professional (SCP) - Society of Human Resource Management, Certified Global Diversity, Equity, Inclusion HR Manager (CDEITM) - Chartered Institute of Professional Certifications, and Artificial Intelligence for HR - Future Workplace, demonstrate my commitment to bridging education and industry while fostering responsible leadership rooted in empathy. With over ten years of teaching experience in Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management, I am deeply committed to delivering impactful instruction and fostering student success. This dedication was recognized with the Best Teacher Award (Students' Choice) at Abasyn University in 2012, underscoring my focus on creating meaningful learning experiences. 
  </p>

  <p>
My vision centers on embedding sustainability, social responsibility, and human-centered AI into business education. As a Certified Carbon Literate educator (PRME & University of Nottingham), I apply climate-conscious principles in both teaching and institutional policy. As Deputy Dean of the College of Business at Al Ain University (UAE) and Acting Chair of the Management Department at A’Sharqiyah University (Oman), I have led curriculum reforms that integrate sustainability and ethics into core business and HRM courses. I also launched the Women Leadership Forum to foster inclusive leadership pipelines, advancing SDGs 5, 8, and 10.  
  </p>


  <p>
As UN-PRME signatory college lead, my commitment to responsible management education has been recognized globally. PRME featured my professional story, highlighting my contributions to sustainability education, youth engagement, and inclusive leadership. Additionally, my perspectives on leadership, equity, and purpose-driven careers were featured in an interview published by Authority Magazine, reflecting my dedication to translating academic expertise into real-world impact. I have also led initiatives such as the 2024 Youth Talks with UN-PRME, engaging students across 100+ countries, and mentoring students globally through the PRME Global Students (PGS) platform, including learners from California and Beijing.  </p>

  <p>
    My scholarly output includes publications in Scopus, ABDC, ABS, and Web of Science-indexed journals, along with edited books, and book chapters on topics such as leadership and organizational behaviour, responsible HRM, human-centered AI, and equity-based learning. My academic philosophy emphasizes developing leaders who are purpose-driven, emotionally intelligent, and ethically grounded in their decision-making.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond academia, I have led consultancy projects including a feasibility study for Pakistan’s Leather Technology Institute, stakeholder engagement with the Islamabad Traffic Police, and entrepreneurship research in Oman-one of which earned the Oman Chamber of Commerce & Industry Award for Best Project in 2016. I have also delivered faculty training workshops on emotional intelligence, sustainability, and communication in the UAE, Oman, and Indonesia. 
  </p>

<p>
  Community engagement has been a cornerstone of my work. My initiatives include launching Industry-Business Day, Student-Research Day, Internship Fairs, International Students Day, and integrating field visits and guest lectures into the curriculum to enhance experiential learning. In recognition of these efforts, I received the Dean’s Award for Community Engagement at Al Ain University in 2021.
</p>

<p>
  Through research-led teaching, human-centered AI integration, innovative curriculum design, and inclusive academic leadership, I am committed to advancing academic excellence and empowering students and institutions to create meaningful, sustainable, and socially responsible impact in education, business, and society.
