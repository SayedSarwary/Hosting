    <p>
    With over a decade of multidisciplinary experience spanning academia, research, and community engagement across the countries, I bring a unique blend of research excellence, curriculum innovation, and inclusive leadership aligned with the future of responsible higher education.
  </p>

    I hold a Ph.D. in Management from the University of Hull, UK (AACSB and AMBA accredited). I am currently pursuing an Ed.D. in Adult Learning and Higher Education at Oregon State University, USA.
    My professional certifications including: SHRM Senior Certified Professional (SCP), Certified Global DEI HR Manager (CDEI), and AI for HR, demonstrate my commitment to bridging education and industry while fostering leadership rooted in empathy and innovation. With over ten years of teaching experience in Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management, I am deeply committed to delivering impactful instruction and fostering student success. This dedication was recognized with the Best Teacher Award (Students' Choice) at Abasyn University in 2012, underscoring my focus on creating meaningful learning experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    My vision centers on embedding sustainability and social responsibility into business education. As a Certified Carbon Literate educator (PRME &amp; University of Nottingham), I apply climate-conscious principles in both teaching and institutional policy. As Deputy Dean of the College of Business at Al Ain University (UAE) and Acting Chair of the Management Department at A’Sharqiyah University (Oman), I have led curriculum reforms that integrate sustainability and ethics into core business and HRM courses. I also launched the Women Leadership Forum to foster inclusive leadership pipelines.
  
    As a deputy dean, I have led strategic initiatives that embed the UN Sustainable Development Goals into research, teaching, and community partnerships. My scholarly output includes publications in Scopus, ABDC, ABS, and Web of Science-indexed journals, along with book chapters on topics such as leadership and organizational behaviour, responsible education and sustainability, and entrepreneurship. I advocate for sustainable HR practices through SHRM and academic networks, and build strategic partnerships that link universities and industry.
  </p>


  <p>
    Community engagement has been a cornerstone of my work. My initiatives include launching Industry-Business Day, Student-Research Day, Internship Fairs, International Students Day, and integrating field visits and guest lectures into the curriculum to enhance experiential learning. In recognition of these efforts, I received the Dean’s Award for Community Engagement at Al Ain University in 2021.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am committed to advancing academic excellence, research impact, and socially responsible leadership. Through research-led teaching, innovative curriculum development, and inclusive academic leadership, I strive to empower students and institutions to create meaningful, sustainable impact in education, business, and society.
