    <h2>Research Statement</h2>
    <div class="left_aligned">
   <p>
My research lies at the intersection of leadership and organizational behavior, sustainable human resource management and human-centered artificial intelligence (AI), with a focus on enhancing inclusivity, productivity, and social responsibility in both organizational and educational contexts. I investigate how leadership styles, organizational culture, policies, and digital transformation, including AI-enabled systems, impact outcomes such as employee well-being, engagement, performance, and students’ learning priorities. Central to my work is the conviction that sustainable, equitable, and technology-empowered practices are not peripheral but essential to shaping resilient organizations and responsible leaders.  </p>

  <p>
A defining feature of my scholarship is the integration of sustainability principles, equity, and human- centric AI into management practices and organizational interventions. My studies examine how institutions can foster inclusive, high-performing, and socially responsible organizational environments. This includes research on leadership’s role in promoting sustainability and the ways in which responsible HRM practices and AI can contribute to organizational resilience, ethical governance, and operational effectiveness.  </p>

  <p>
I am equally committed to bridging theory and practice. My research on women’s leadership and equity- based learning has yielded practical frameworks that inform curriculum reform, organizational policy, and public dialogue. Initiatives such as the UN-PRME Youth Talks project, which engaged students across 200+ countries, have enabled me to explore how global youth perceive sustainability challenges, contributing cross-cultural and intergenerational insights to responsible management education.  </p>

  <p>
    My current projects explore the dynamic intersections of digital transformation, human-centric leadership, sustainability, and AI adoption. Specifically, I investigate the drivers, barriers, and impacts of AI adoption and integration in public and complex organizational settings. These studies examine how AI capability, digital transformation, training, trust, transparency, and organizational culture influence workforce productivity, resilience, psychological safety, and sustainable employee behaviors, with evidence drawn from UAE-based public and smart city contexts.

  </p>

  <p>
Looking ahead, my research agenda builds on these foundations and pursues three interrelated streams:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sustainable behaviors and practices:</strong> advancing understanding of employees’ sustainable behaviors, climate-conscious workplace initiatives, and sustainable HRM practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> exploring structural, cultural, and digital enablers, including AI and innovation ecosystems, that support women leaders, both employed and entrepreneurial, in contributing to inclusive economies.</li>
    <li><strong>Equity in education:</strong> examining policy-oriented approaches that link inclusive curriculum design and educational equity, promoting accessibility and social responsibility in higher education.</li>
<br>  </ul>

  <p>
Through this agenda, I aim to generate actionable insights that bridge scholarship, practice, and policy. By integrating AI, sustainability, and social equity, my work contributes to building organizations and institutions that are resilient, socially responsible, and future-ready, preparing leaders to address global challenges effectively and ethically.  </p>
