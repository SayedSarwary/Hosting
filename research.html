    <h2>Research Statement</h2>
    <div class="left_aligned">
  <p>
    My research lies at the intersection of organizational behavior, sustainable human resource management, leadership, and entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on advancing inclusivity, productivity, and social responsibility in both organizational and educational contexts. I investigate how leadership styles, organizational policies, and digital transformation — including the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) — influence outcomes such as employee well-being, engagement, performance, and students’ learning priorities. Central to my work is the conviction that sustainable and equitable practices are not peripheral but essential to shaping resilient organizations and responsible leaders.
  </p>

  <p>
    A defining feature of my scholarship is the integration of sustainability principles and equity into management practices and organizational interventions. My studies employ mixed-methods approaches, multi-level modeling, and global comparative perspectives to understand how institutions can foster inclusive, high-performing, and socially responsible environments. This has included research on leadership’s role in promoting sustainability, the application of AI in sustainable HRM, and the ways in which green HRM practices contribute to organizational sustainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am equally committed to bridging theory and practice. My research on women’s entrepreneurship, equity-based learning, and leadership development has yielded practical frameworks that inform curriculum reform, organizational policy, and public dialogue. Through initiatives such as the UN-PRME Youth Talks project, which engaged youth across 200+ countries, I have explored how global youth perceive sustainability challenges, contributing cross-cultural and generational insights to responsible management education.
  </p>

  <p>
    Current projects explore the dynamic intersections of digital transformation, human-centric leadership, entrepreneurship, and sustainability. For instance, I examine how AI-enabled high-performance work systems can simultaneously drive organizational productivity and support employee learning and development. Parallel studies investigate the role of organizational justice, motivation, and emotional climates in fostering inclusive workplaces, advancing integrated models for employee well-being and performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking ahead, my research agenda builds on these foundations to pursue three interrelated streams:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sustainable behaviors and practices:</strong> advancing understanding of green consumption, sustainable HRM, and climate-conscious workplace initiatives;</li>
    <li><strong>Entrepreneurship and women’s empowerment:</strong> exploring the structural, cultural, and digital enablers that support women entrepreneurs in building sustainable ventures and contributing to inclusive economies;</li>
    <li><strong>Equity and access in education:</strong> examining policy-oriented approaches that connect inclusive curriculum design to educational access, poverty reduction, and equity in learning;</li>
<br>  </ul>

  <p>
    Through this agenda, I seek to generate actionable insights that support both scholarly advancement and practical impact. By bridging technology, sustainability, and social equity, my work contributes to building organizations and educational systems that not only perform effectively but also prepare future leaders to act responsibly in addressing pressing global challenges.
