    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <div class="left_aligned">
  <p>
I am a seasoned academician with over a decade of experience in teaching, academic leadership, and administration across the Middle East and South Asia. Since 2010, I have taught a wide spectrum of undergraduate and graduate courses in Organizational Behavior and Leadership, Human Resource Management, and general Management, combining theoretical foundations with practical applications, experiential learning, sustainability principles, and human-centered AI applications in organizational and HR contexts. My teaching approach emphasizes student engagement, research integration, responsible use of technology, and professional readiness, preparing students to thrive in dynamic, AI-augmented organizational environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    In parallel with my teaching, I have held key leadership roles, including Deputy Dean at Al Ain University, Acting Chair of the Management Department at A’Sharqiyah University, and Head of Management Sciences at Abasyn University. In these capacities, I have overseen curriculum development, faculty mentoring, strategic planning, and program accreditation aligned with national and international quality standards (AACSB, QAA, CAA, OAAA). I have led comprehensive curriculum reforms, including aligning BBA-HRM and MBA-HRM programs with the Society for Human Resource Management; and embedding sustainability and responsible leadership across the business curriculum.
  </p>

  <p>
My administrative experience includes chairing and serving on multiple college and university-level committees, such as the Curriculum Committee, Course File Committee, Strategic Planning Committee, Accreditation Committee, and Academic Quality Assurance Committee, contributing to institutional excellence, policy development, and continuous improvement. I have facilitated industry-academia collaborations, launched programs such as the Women Leadership Forum, and organized high-impact events including Industry-Business Days, Student Research Days, International Students Days, Women Entrepreneurs-oriented events, Research Symposiums, and Doctoral Colloquia, while hosting global exchange students. These initiatives ensure that students gain practical exposure, hands-on research experience, and international perspectives, fostering leadership, innovation, and sustainability-driven mindsets.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to academic leadership, I have managed research projects and engaged with professional networks and industry leaders, translating scholarly insights into tangible organizational and societal impact. Early in my career, I gained industrial experience in corporate banking and SME financing, providing a strong foundation for bridging theory and practice in management education.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through my dual focus on innovative yet sustainability-driven teaching and strategic academic leadership, I strive to cultivate socially responsible, inclusive, and empowered learners while advancing institutional excellence, research impact, and sustainable practices across higher education and professional environments.
