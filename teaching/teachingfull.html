    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <div class="left_aligned">
<p>
  My primary teaching goal is to empower students to develop the skills, knowledge, and confidence they need to succeed at work and in life as responsible human beings. I believe learning is the responsibility of the student, but teaching is my duty -one that requires creating the right environment, setting high expectations, and guiding students through meaningful engagement. My approach emphasizes faculty-to- learner and learner-to-learner interaction, shifting the role of the teacher from knowledge dispenser to learning facilitator.
  </p>

  <p>

I have taught a wide range of Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management courses at both undergraduate (BBA) and postgraduate (MBA, DBA) levels, to diverse groups of students in terms of age, ethnicity, prior work experience, and personal circumstances. I strive to create an engaging, student- centered environment where learners actively participate, share perspectives, and collaborate with peers and faculty. This approach fosters critical thinking, respect for diverse viewpoints, and deeper learning through real-world connections, including the integration of human-centered AI applications, sustainability principles, and technology-enabled decision-making in organizational and HR contexts.
  </p>

  <p>

    I view effective teaching as the integration of three elements: mastery of content, strong communication, and empathy for student needs. Subject expertise alone is not enough; concepts must be conveyed in ways that are clear, accessible, and relevant. Equally important, faculty must approach students with empathy and psychological awareness, recognizing their diverse challenges and motivations. When empathy is combined with high expectations, students rise to the challenge. This aligns with the Pygmalion Effect, which demonstrates that when students believe their instructors genuinely expect them to succeed, they enhance their learning outcomes, self-efficacy, and motivation. I have seen my students meet high expectations simply by continuously communicating my belief in their potential and being available to support their learning beyond teaching and office hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    To strengthen engagement, I use a mix of teaching techniques -case studies, discussions, applied projects, role-plays, and guest sessions- while infusing humor and storytelling to sustain interest. I create an environment where learners feel safe in sharing. I draw from my professional and research experience to connect classroom theory with practice, exposing students to real-world insights in business, sustainability, leadership, and AI-enabled management systems. For instance, I guided BBA students to present their research at the International Students Research Confluence, with submissions to an international conference, providing them with invaluable global exposure and academic growth. My DBA students from the first semester were able to learn research concepts and conduct empirical studies presented in a doctoral colloquium with confidence within just four months.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond the classroom, I embed industry, community, and technology exposure into the learning journey. Initiatives such as Industry-Business Day, Student Research Days, Cultural Day, Women Leadership Forum, Entrepreneurship-related events, and guest lectures give students platforms to showcase knowledge, refine communication skills, and practice teamwork in authentic settings. Fieldwork and applied research are integral to my pedagogy, nurturing academic rigor alongside an appreciation for cultural diversity, social responsibility, and technological literacy.
  </p>

  <p>
Over the years, I have redesigned curricula to align with global professional standards, such as the Society for Human Resource Management curriculum for HRM majors, and pioneered the integration of sustainability principles in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and UAE Vision. I employ innovative assessments, including: practical exercises, peer reviews, research projects, interactive presentations, and so on, to ensure students are evaluated holistically, not just through exams.

  </p>

  <p>
I place great importance on personalization and student connection. Small gestures, such as addressing students by name, encouraging diverse group work, and engaging with them informally during class breaks and after class, help reduce barriers and foster belonging. Attendance challenges, a common regional issue, are addressed through proactive advising and building trust-based relationships that cultivate accountability and encourage participation.  </p>

  <p>

Ultimately, I believe teaching extends beyond content delivery, it requires modeling ethical behavior, fairness, and responsibility. A true educator inspires students not only to think critically but also to act ethically, becoming future leaders who positively influence society. By blending structure with innovation, empathy with expectations, theory with practice, and technology with sustainability, I aim to cultivate classrooms that are interactive, inclusive, and transformative. My ultimate goal is to prepare students to take ownership of their learning, apply it confidently, and emerge as responsible, ethical, AI- literate, and impactful professionals.  </p>
