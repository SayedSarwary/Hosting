    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <div class="left_aligned">
<p>
    My primary teaching goal is to empower students to develop the skills, knowledge, and confidence they need to succeed. I believe learning is the responsibility of the student, but teaching is my duty, one that requires creating the right environment, setting high expectations, and guiding students through meaningful engagement. My approach emphasizes faculty-to-learner and learner-to-learner interaction, shifting the role of the teacher from knowledge dispenser to learning facilitator.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have taught a wide range of Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management courses at both undergraduate (BBA) and postgraduate (MBA, DBA) levels. I strive to create an engaging, student-centered environment where learners actively participate, share perspectives, and collaborate with peers and faculty. This approach fosters critical thinking, respect for diverse viewpoints, and deeper learning through real-world connections.
  </p>

  <p>
    I view effective teaching as the integration of three elements: mastery of content, strong communication, and empathy for student needs. Subject expertise alone is not enough; concepts must be conveyed in ways that are clear, accessible, and relevant. Equally important, faculty must approach students with empathy and psychological awareness, recognizing their diverse challenges and motivations. When empathy is combined with high expectations, students rise to the challenge. This aligns with the Pygmalion Effect, which demonstrates that when students believe their instructors genuinely expect them to succeed, they enhance their learning outcomes, self-efficacy, and motivation.
  </p>

  <p>
    To strengthen engagement, I use a mix of teaching techniques: case studies, discussions, applied projects, role-plays, and guest sessions, while infusing humor and storytelling to sustain interest. I draw from my professional and research experience to connect classroom theory with practice, exposing students to real-world insights in business, sustainability, diversity, and leadership. For instance, I guided BBA students to present their research at the International Students Research Confluence, with submissions to an international conference, providing them with invaluable global exposure and academic growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond the classroom, I embed industry and community exposure into the learning journey. Initiatives such as Industry-Business Day, Student Research Day, Internship Fairs, Cultural Day, and guest lectures give students platforms to showcase knowledge, refine communication skills, and practice teamwork in authentic settings. Fieldwork, surveys, and applied research are integral to my pedagogy, nurturing academic rigor alongside an appreciation for cultural diversity and social responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the years, I have also redesigned curricula to align with global professional standards, such as the SHRM curriculum for HRM majors, and pioneered the integration of sustainability principles in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and UAE Vision. I employ innovative assessments, like practical exercises, peer reviews, research projects, and interactive presentations, to ensure students are evaluated holistically, not just through exams.
  </p>

  <p>
    I place great importance on personalization and student connection. Small gestures, such as addressing students by name, encouraging diverse group work, and engaging with them informally during class breaks, help reduce barriers and foster belonging. Attendance challenges, a common regional issue, are addressed through proactive advising and building trust-based relationships that cultivate accountability and encourage participation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, I believe teaching extends beyond content delivery; it requires modeling ethical behavior, fairness, and responsibility. A true educator inspires students not only to think critically but also to act ethically, becoming future leaders who positively influence society. By blending structure with innovation, empathy with expectations, and theory with practice, I aim to cultivate classrooms that are interactive, inclusive, and transformative. My ultimate goal is to prepare students to take ownership of their learning, apply it with confidence, and emerge as responsible, ethical, and impactful professionals.
